Improving the UI:
-moving the feedback option to the bottom
-showing a toggle button for switching the modes: Play/Spot
-changing the icon for the Spot mode - something like an ear icon
-attaching the Settings button more to the central part
-attaching the bottom button more to the central part to make it clear they are related to it

Controlling the app:
-Adding keyboard support for the confirm button
-Adding keyboard support for the next button

Help
-adding a help icon to launch a tutorial on using the app - a youtube video (hosted on my site, custom video player controls, max 90 sec)
